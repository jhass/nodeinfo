# NodeInfo

NodeInfo is an effort to create a standardized way of exposing metadata
about a server running one of the distributed social networks. The two key
goals are being able to get better insights into the user base of distributed
social networking and the ability to build tools that allow users to choose
the best fitting software and server for their needs.

## History

NodeInfo emerged from it's predecessor `/statistics.json` that was added
to the diaspora* software to be able to built a statistics collection and
aggregation service, it was quickly supported by Friendica and RedMatrix.
As more and more metadata was added and modifications occurred that would
break backward compatibility, we felt the need to make this a more coordinated
effort.
